        <p class="top">
            Sorting refers to ordering data in an increasing or decreasing manner according to some linear relationship
            among the data items.
            <br>
            In computer science, sorting is a common operation in
            many applications, and efficient algorithms have been developed to perform it.
            <br>
            A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison
            operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the
            respective data structure.

        <h2><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/insertion.html">Insertion sort</a></h2>
        <p>Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each
            iteration.
            <br>
            Insertion sort works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game.
            <br>
            We assume that the first card is already sorted then, we select an unsorted card. If the unsorted card
            is greater than the card in hand, it is placed on the right otherwise, to the left. In the same way,
            other unsorted cards are taken and put in their right place.
            <br>
            A similar approach is used by insertion sort.

        <p>Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in

            Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the
            array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.

        <p>Merge Sort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms that is based on the principle of Divide and
            Conquer Algorithm.
            <br>
            Here, a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved individually. Finally,
            sub-problems are combined to form the final solution.

        <h2><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/quick.html">Quick sort</a></h2>
        <p>Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach where
            <br>
            An array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element (element selected from the array).
            <br>
            While dividing the array, the pivot element should be positioned in such a way that elements less than
            pivot are kept on the left side and elements greater than pivot are on the right side of the pivot.
            The left and right subarrays are also divided using the same approach. This process continues until each
            subarray contains a single element.
            <br>
            At this point, elements are already sorted. Finally, elements are combined to form a sorted array.

        <h2><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/heap.html">Heap sort</a></h2>
        <p>Heap Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm in computer programming. Learning how to write the
            heap sort algorithm requires knowledge of two types of data structures - arrays and trees.
            <br>
            The initial set of numbers that we want to sort is stored in an array e.g. [10, 3, 76, 34, 23, 32] and
            after sorting, we get a sorted array [3,10,23,32,34,76].
            <br>
            Heap sort works by visualizing the elements of the array as a special kind of complete binary tree
            called a heap.
